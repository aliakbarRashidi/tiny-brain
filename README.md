-----------------

After spending more than a year working on a from scratch deep learning C++ stack ([neurocl](http://github.com/blackccpie/neurocl)), I decided to switch my experiments to use a more established C++ framework, that is [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn).

****Cloning****

tiny-brain includes tiny-dnn as a _git submodule_, therefore use the following command line for recursive cloning:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/blackccpie/tiny-brain.git
```
